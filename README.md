# Quant Protocol

Smart contracts for Quant. Rolla's EVM-based options protocol.

## Description

The Quant Protocol is a decentralized options protocol allowing anyone to mint and trade 100% collateralized, cash-settled European options.

The Quant protocol tokenizes options using the ERC20 standard, and also tokenizes a receipt of mint known as a "CollateralToken" which uses the ERC1155 standard. Minting an option requires more collateral than will be claimed by the exerciser. The Collateral Token entitles the option minter to reclaim any excess collateral once the option has expired. For a deep dive into the inner workings, view our [docs](https://docs.rolla.finance/getting-started/introduction).

[Rolla](https://rolla.finance) is a DeFi structured product platform built on the Quant Protocol that allows anyone to get risk-based yield on various cryptocurrencies or stablecoin. This is accomplished via selling out of the money European covered call and put options on the Quant Protocol.
